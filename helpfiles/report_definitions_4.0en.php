	clinic.  It may only be appropriate to consider current care needs
	and to examine quality of care issues (whether tests have been
	provided at the appropriate intervals, whether treatment has been
	offered according to guidelines, etc.) among active patients and to
	disregard inactive and discontinued patients.  </FONT>

	have the test because they were not being seen in the clinic at all
	(inactive patients).  The problems posed by these 2 groups of
