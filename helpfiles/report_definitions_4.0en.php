	many reports, it is important to distinguish between &ldquo;active&rdquo;
	patients and patients who are not being seen regularly in the
	clinic.  It may only be appropriate to consider current care needs
	and to examine quality of care issues (whether tests have been
	provided at the appropriate intervals, whether treatment has been
	offered according to guidelines, etc.) among active patients and to
	disregard inactive and discontinued patients.  </FONT>

	last year could include patients who should have had the test but
	did not (active patients) and those who never had the opportunity to
	have the test because they were not being seen in the clinic at all
	(inactive patients).  The problems posed by these 2 groups of
	patients are different, and should be examined separately.</FONT></P>
