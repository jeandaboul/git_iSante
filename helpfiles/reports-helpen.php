<p>This tool allows you to view iSante indicator statistics in a variety of ways. You can view by different time periods, display details about each indicator, see charts, view lists of patients and more.</p><br />
<p>Try experimenting with the interface to see how it works. Here's a few tips if you get stuck:</p><br />

<p>The report first loads to show top level indicators over the most recent six years. From here you can adjust the filters at the top of the page to show another view. To interact with the data, try <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">moving your mouse over any of the indicators</span>. As you move over the table, you can click on the icons to trigger some of the reporting features.</p><br />

<h3>Using the Report Filters</h3>

<p>To change the report, follow these three steps:</p>
<p style="margin: 10px 0 10px 20px">1. Choose a time period. You can view the reports by Year, Month or Week</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 20px">2. Decide whether indicator details should be displayed. You can choose to display "subrows" for each indicator that show details by Network, Department, Commune or Clinic. If you choose one of these options, you can then sort the details by name or by count.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 20px">3. Click on "Filter" to load the report. Once you click the report table will reload. If you chose to display details, you can view them for any indicator by clicking on the <i class="icon-chevron-down icon-gray"></i> that appears next to the indicator name.</p>

<h3>Interacting with the Data</h3>
<p>When the report loads, you can move forward and backwards in time by click on the buttons on the right side of the page. For example, if you're currently viewing months 7-12 of 2013, when you click on the "Older results" button, you'll see months 1-6 of 2013.</p><br />
<p>When you move your mouse over the report table, you'll see icons:</p><br />
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 20px"><span class="chart-launch"><i></i></span> - View a graph for that row of data over time.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 20px"><i class="icon-list report-icon"></i> - View list of patients for that indicator and time period.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 20px"><i class="icon-zoom-in report-icon"></i> - View counts of patient communes - localities for that indicator and time period. Note: this is only available for the national level indicators, not for any details.</p>

<p>Note: The icon tools will not appear for any item that is zero. There'd be nothing to display!</p>
