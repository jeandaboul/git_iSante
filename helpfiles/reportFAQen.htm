style='font-size:16.0pt;color:navy'>Frequently Asked Questions</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:navy'>What is the difference between
inactive and discontinued patients? </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Inactive" patients are defined as follows:</p>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>Inactive patients on ART:  All patients ever dispensed ART medications at the reporting clinic site with no visits of any kind in the last 90 days.  Visits may include clinical evaluation, laboratory, or pharmacy services.  Patients for whom a discontinuation form has been completed are not considered inactive patients, even if they have not had a visit in the last 90 days.</p>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>Inactive patients in palliative care (not on ART):  All patients who have never received ART medications at the reporting clinic site with no follow-up visits in the last 180 days.  Patients for whom a discontinuation form has been completed are not considered inactive patients, even if they have not had a follow-up visit in the last 180 days.</p>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>A patient is only counted as "Discontinued" if a 
discontinuation form has been completed for that patient. "Inactive" patients and "Discontinued"
patients represent separate categories, so "Inactive" patients do not also
appear on the list of "Discontinued" patients.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:navy'>What is the difference between "Active"
patients and patients "At risk of discontinuation"?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Active" patients are defined as follows:</p>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>Active patients on ART:  All patients ever dispensed ART medications at the reporting clinic site, excluding patients dispensed ART for PMTCT or PEP, with at least one visit of any kind in the last 90 days.  Visits may include clinical evaluation, laboratory, or pharmacy services.  Patients for whom a discontinuation form has been completed are not considered active patients, even if they have had a visit in the last 90 days.</p>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>Active patients in palliative care (not on ART):  All patients who have never received ART medications at the reporting clinic site who have had at least one visit in the last 180 days.  Visits may include clinical evaluation, laboratory, or pharmacy services.  Patients for whom a discontinuation form has been completed are not considered active patients, even if they have had a visit in the last 180 days.</p>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>
Patients "At risk of discontinuation" are defined as follows:</p>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>Patients on ART at risk of discontinuation:  All new or active patients ever dispensed ART medications at the reporting clinic site who have missed their next scheduled prescription pickup by more than 8 days.  Patients for whom a discontinuation form has been completed are not considered as at risk patients, even if they have missed their next scheduled prescription pickup by more than 8 days.</p>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>Patients in palliative care (not on ART) at risk of discontinuation:  All new or active patients who have never received ART medications at the reporting clinic site who have missed their next scheduled appointment  by more than 30 days.  Patients for whom a discontinuation form has been completed are not considered as at risk patients, even if they have missed their next scheduled appointment  by more than 30 days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:navy'>What should be done if a
discontinued patient later re-enters care and treatment?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a discontinuation form is completed, the patient
record is not erased from the EMR database. All the patient's data remain in
the system. Therefore, if a patient re-enters care and treatment, a site data
manager may delete their discontinuation form and the clinical team can
resume creating new visit records for the patient. At this point, the discontinuation
form remains in the system, but with a "flag" as a deleted form. Once the
discontinuation form is deleted, the patient will again be recognized in one
of the other patient status categories (Active, At risk of discontinuation, Inactive).
It is possible to enter another discontinuation form at a later date, if the
patient is discontinued for a second time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:navy'>Among the <i>Quality of Care</i>
reports, what is the difference between the <i>Reminder</i> reports (<i>Appointment
Reminders</i>, <i>Lab Test Reminders</i>, and <i>Care Reminders</i>) and the <i>Indicator
</i>reports (<i>Appropriate Lab Test Indicators</i>, <i>Appropriate Treatment
Indicators</i>)? </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <i>Reminder</i> reports are designed for prospective
use &#150; to look ahead to what is needed in the care of patients. These reports
provide lists of patients who should have specific follow up, based upon what
happened (or did not happen) in their earlier visits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <i>Indicator</i> reports are designed for retrospective use &#150; to
look backwards at the patterns of care provided over time in the past. These
indicators serve as measures of the quality of patient care and can help clinic
leaders to identify areas to target for improved performance.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:navy'>How should the <i>Quality of
Care</i> reports be interpreted?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These reports should be used to look for trends over time in
the indicators. People using the reports should be aware to interpret the
indicators for the current and previous calendar periods with caution. The
reports on ART enrollment, Cotrimoxizole prophylaxis, and TB treatment all use
criteria that patients should be enrolled on the appropriate medications within
3 months of meeting the medical eligibility criteria. Therefore, the report
indicators can only be considered "firm" 3 months after the time window of
interest. For example, if one runs a report in January, 2007 on ART
enrollment, Cotrimoxizole initiation, or TB treatment initiation, it is
possible that those patients who met the respective eligibility criteria in
December 2006 might not start the medication until after January, 2007. If you
run this same report in April, 2007, you can interpret the data for the time
window of July-December 2006 as "firm." At this point you will know that any
patients who did not receive the recommended medication by the end March 2006,
were truly falling outside the standard of care (that appropriate treatment or
prophylaxis be initiated within 3 months of meeting the medical eligibility
criteria).</p>
